## The functionality must include:
   - Current day’s forecast as mocked up (but using live data), showing hour, temp, and associated icon. 
   - Responsive layout that collapses to a single column view in narrow viewports (make the hour items 100% wide). 
   - Make any design or functional improvements you'd like. Write about these modifications in a comment in the HTML section.
   - Accessible markup and SCSS syntax (no CSS frameworks).
   - Use Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks, no PHP. Don't do it in React or Vue.
   - ES6 syntax.
   - Geolocation by default (with zipcode input box failover if user denies permissions).
   - "Not here?" should bring the user to the zipcode input box.
   - Weather API: <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api/">openweathermap.org/api/</a>
   - Zip code form should self-validate.
   - Use SVG weather icons: <a href="http://alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/">alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/</a>.
   - Comment your code thoroughly. 
   - Put this on codepen.io.
