# Weather-Frontend-Test
General FE test


## What to Build

Create the following single page application, based on the mockup below.

### The functionality must include:
   - Responsive layout that collapses to a single column view in narrow viewports (make the hour items 100% wide). 
   - Accessible markup and SCSS syntax (no CSS frameworks).
   - Comment your work as if you were part of a awesome, collaboritve team.
   - Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks, no PHP. Don't do it in React or Vue.
   - ES6 syntax.
   - Geolocation by default (with zipcode input box failover if user denies permissions).
   - "Not here?" should bring the user to the zipcode input box.
   - Weather API: <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api/">openweathermap.org/api/</a>
   - Current day’s forecast as mocked up (but using live data)
   - Put this on codepen.io
#### Also:
 - Make any design or functional improvements you see fit
 - Zip code form should self-validate
 - Use SVG weather icons: <a href="http://alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/">alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/</a>
